# webpage-css-practice
* Some basic css styles added to my html pages using inline, internal and external styling.
* In this task we'll also make use of Bootstrap for styling.
<br/>

<p>Please note that this web page is not a functional Web Page.</p>
<p>This page purely focuses on CSS styling of a Web Page.</p>
<br/>

<p>This project is one of my first attempts to using css.</p>
<p>The purpose of the page is purely for css styling practice.</p>

## Web Page Example:

<img src="screenshots-of-page/htmlPage1.JPG" alt="View of Web Page 1">
<img src="screenshots-of-page/htmlPage2.JPG" alt="View of Web Page 2">
<img src="screenshots-of-page/htmlPage3.JPG" alt="View of Web Page 3">
<img src="screenshots-of-page/htmlPage4.JPG" alt="View of Web Page 4">
<img src="screenshots-of-page/htmlPage5.JPG" alt="View of Web Page 5">

## Use of the code for the HTML pages above:
<p>Think of CSS as clothing for a human, it has all to do with style and layout of a Web Page.</p>
<p>In order to use the code, open it via a browser once the files are on your local drive.</p>
<p>In order to edit the code, i'd recommend using text editor like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Please feel free to make use of the code.</p>
